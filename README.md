# Control Structures Exercise

## Overview
This project is based on the Control Structures Exercise from the Base documentation:  
[Control Structures Exercise](https://docs.base.org/base-learn/docs/control-structures/control-structures-exercise/).

It demonstrates the use of control structures in Solidity through two primary functions:
1. **FizzBuzz**: Returns "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or "Splat" based on divisibility rules.
2. **DoNotDisturb**: Determines availability based on time input and reverts during restricted hours.
